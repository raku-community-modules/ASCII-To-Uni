=head1 NAME

ASCII::To::Uni - convert operators in Raku source files from ASCII to Unicode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use ASCII::To::Uni;

convert-file($filename);

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<ASCII::To::Uni> distribution provides a basic (and incomplete)
way to convert operators in your Raku-related source files from an
ASCII version to Unicode symbol version.

It doesn't support some operators and has some limitations.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

This distribution has two basic subroutines:

=head2 convert-file

The C<convert-file> subroutine takes a file name and by default point
s output to a new file with extension like C<file-name.uni.xtension>.

A different path can be set with the C<:new-path> named argument. It
can rewrite file if the named argument C<:rewrite> was specified with
a C<True> value. However, rewriting is not recommended, since this
distribution way still be buggy and can mess up your work.

=head2 convert-string

The C<convert-string> subroutine takes read-write string and converts
it accordingly to operator table.

=head2 HISTORY

This distribution started as C<Texas::To::Uni>, but since the use of
the term "Texas" has been deprecated in favor of "ASCII", it felt like
a good opportunity to change the name when reviving it as a Raku
Community module.  Note that the old name C<Texas::To::Uni> is still
available as a use target.
